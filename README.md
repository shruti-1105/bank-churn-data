Project Title: Predictive Analysis of Bank Churn Rates: Understanding Customer Attrition

Introduction:
In today's competitive banking sector, understanding and mitigating customer churn (the rate at which customers stop doing business with a bank) is crucial for maintaining profitability and sustaining growth. This project aims to analyze bank churn data to identify patterns and factors contributing to customer attrition, ultimately developing predictive models to anticipate churn and inform retention strategies.

Objectives:

Analyze historical bank churn data to identify trends and patterns.
Determine key factors influencing customer churn.
Develop predictive models to forecast future churn rates.
Evaluate the effectiveness of various retention strategies.
Dataset:
The dataset for this analysis includes historical customer data such as demographics, transaction history, account status, customer service interactions, and any other relevant variables. Each record represents a unique customer and includes a churn indicator (1 for churned, 0 for active).

Methodology:

Data Preprocessing: Cleanse the data, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering to extract relevant insights.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the dataset to identify correlations, distributions, and anomalies.
Feature Selection: Determine the most influential features using techniques such as correlation analysis and feature importance.
Model Interpretation: Interpret the results to understand the relative importance of different features in predicting churn.
Retention Strategy Recommendations: Based on the insights gained, propose actionable retention strategies to reduce churn rates.
